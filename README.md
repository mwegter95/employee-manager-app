## Description

This repo contains an app for using Inquirer as a command line interface for accessing an employee database. The app uses node.js and mysql2 to keep a database of employees, and the user selects options in the command line. This is for U of M bootcamp challenge 12. Current functionality is detailed below.

[ ] = empty checkbox  
[x] = completed checkbox  

[x] GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
WHEN I start the application  
[x] THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role  
WHEN I choose to view all departments  
[x] THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids  
WHEN I choose to view all roles  
[x] THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role  
WHEN I choose to view all employees  
[x] THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to  
WHEN I choose to add a department  
[x] THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database  
WHEN I choose to add a role  
[x] THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
